# [DS] Build mechanism to update centroid and userâ€™s centroid

## Objective
- Everyday, new model is trained lead to user embeddings change and new user embeddings is added. theses changees can affect the embedding of user groups. The objective of this task is to adjust the user group embedding based on new trained model to prevent drifting in user group space.


## Procedures
- Get new trained user model
    - download new model
    - get model embedding
    - get list of users
    - combine two info
- Cluster on new embedding space
- Compare old cluster and new cluster then do the mapping
    - ensuring 1-1 mapping
    - if not 1-1, what to do next

<Code language="python">
\# import libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

\# download multiple files from gcs
def download_multiple_files_from_gcs(bucket_name, prefix, local_dir):
    """
    Download multiple files from a GCS bucket to a local directory
    """
    from google.cloud import storage
    import os
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
    blobs = bucket.list_blobs(prefix=prefix)
    for blob in blobs:
        filename = blob.name.split('/')[-1]
        if filename:
            print(os.path.join(local_dir, filename))
            blob.download_to_filename(os.path.join(local_dir, filename))
            print("Downloaded file {} from GCS".format(filename))
